LeakTracer is a small tool I wrote when checking a C++ program for memory
leaks. I couldn't get dmalloc to display what I wanted, and I just saw the
__builtin_return_address gcc-extension mentioned.

To use LeakTracer, run your program using the provided LeakCheck script. It
uses the LD_PRELOAD feature to "overlay" some functions on top of your
functions (no recompile needed). If your platform does not support LD_PRELOAD,
you can add the LeakTracer.o object file to the objects in your Makefile and
run your application. 

LeakTracer uses gdb to print out the exact line where the memory was allocated
and not freed - this of course means you have to free all dynamically
allocated data. LeakTracer also overrides the global operator new and operator
delete - this will give problems if you override them as well.

LeakTracer traces only new/new[] and delete calls - it does not look at
malloc/free/realloc.

Here is some example output:

Gathered 8 (8 unique) points of data.
(gdb)
Allocations: 1 / Size: 36
0x80608e6 is in NullArcableInstance::NullArcableInstance(void) (Machine.cc:40).
39      public:

</PRE><h3><a name="chap1">Requirements</a></h3><PRE>
You need Perl5 and gdb installed to run the leak-analyzer. You need gcc -- I
currently use 2.95 but have used it with previous older versions without
problems.
You also need to run this on an architecture which supports
__builtin_return_address arguments that are greater than 0 - there may be
some problems on MIPS there. 

So far this code has been tested under Linux 2.2, x86 system, Solaris and
HP-UX.
</PRE><h3><a name="chap2">Installation</a></h3><PRE>
Just type make. There is no install target; you should put LeakTracer
some place you can remember.

Since version 2.0, it is possible to preload the LeakTracer object on
architectures that support LD_PRELOAD (this is at least Linux and probably
others -- please report success/failure). This means it is much easier to use
the program: you do not need to relink your program with LeakTracer.o.

In case your platform does not support LD_PRELOAD, you can use LeakTracer in
the old pre 2.0 way: add LeakTracer.o to your object files -- at the very end
of them (also after -llibrary lines).

In any case your application must also be compiled with debugging enabled
(i.e. -g).

</PRE><h3><a name="chap3">Running with LeakTracer</a></h3><PRE>
If you are using the shared object, run the LeakCheck script. This script
should stay in the directory where you install LeakCheck -- it will search for
LeakTracer.so file there and load it. E.g.:

~/src/LeakTracer/LeakCheck yourApplication

(if you put LeakTracer in ~/src/LeakTracer/)

Run your application as normal, performing tasks that you want to be traced
for memory leaks. While the application runs, LeakTracer will write data about
memory allocation to the file "leak.out" in the current directory. You can
override the location of that file by setting the LEAKTRACE_FILE environment
variable.

If you cannot use LD_PRELOAD, just run your application as normal after
relinking it. It will also produce a "leak.out" file when it finishes.
</PRE><h3><a name="chap4">Detectable errors</a></h3><PRE>
LeakTracer is capable to detect the following problems with your program

  1) memory which is allocated but not freed
  2) (limited support for) overwritten memory at the end of the allocated
     block  ( reason = 1 )
  3) memory which is tried to be deleted but which is not allocated
     (either because of a garbage pointer or twice deletion)
     (reason = 2)
  4) memory which is allocated with new[] but deleted with simple delete
     and vice versa (reason = 4)

For the last three problems, LeakTracer can abort() your program if you
tell it so; the resulting core-dump allows to debug the problem. By default,
only the overwrite memory condition results in an abort of the program
because it is inherently critical. The two other conditions are not critical.
You can influence what LeakTracer does with the environment variable
   LT_ABORTREASON
which you can set to some numeric value which is the result of the
sum of the reasons you find in the parentesis in the enumeration above.
To abort on any reason, for example, you would set LT_ABORTREASON to 7.
</PRE><h3><a name="chap5">Analyzing output</a></h3><PRE>
You should then run leak-analyze, since looking at the raw leak.out file will
not help you much. To run leak-analyze, you need Perl as well as gdb
installed (any version of gdb will do). For example:

leak-analyze myprog leak.out

You don't have to specify the leak.out filename if you just use the default
one. leak-analyze will run gdb on the file, sending it a number of commands
that will show the source lines with the memory leaks.

leak-analyze should show you something like this:

Gathered 2 (2 unique) points of data.

#-- Alloc: Different allocation schemes
alloc here :0x80485b7 is in main (test.cc:6).
5
6               int *wrong = new int[10];
..free here :0x80485d9 is in main (test.cc:11).
11              delete wrong;

#-- Leak: Allocations: 1 / Size: 168 
0x8048593 is in main (test.cc:3).
2       int main() {
3               int *array = new int [42] ;

#-- Leak: Allocations: 1 / Size: 4 
0x80485a5 is in main (test.cc:4).
3               int *array = new int [42] ;
4               int *foo = new int;
This means that total of two allocations happened, in two different places.

First a delete error is shown: you allocated some memory using new[] but you
freed it using delete. leak-analyze will show where you allocated the memory and where you freed it.

Afterwards each allocation is shown in turn. There was 1 allocation from this
line of code (test.cc:3), and it was 168 bytes in size. Note that of the two
lines of code shown, it's the bottom one that created the allocation.

That's all there is to it - now you should find those memory leaks, fix them
and rerun Leak tracer.

</PRE><h3><a name="chap6">Shared libraries and objects</a></h3><PRE>
If you want to analyze the leaks in shared libraries in your file, it may be
necessary to make leak-analyze run your program and thus load the shared
libraries before searching for addresses.

To do that, run leak-analyze with the program name, leak name AND another
argument which is where to set the breakpoint, e.g.:

leak-analyze myprog leak.out main

This will make leak-analyze tell gdb to set a breakpoint on "main" and then
run the program. After the analysis is complete, the program will be killed.

If you want to load some shared libraries, you can set a breakpoint on a
different location, e.g. main.cc:42 if you know that once line 42 is reached,
all shared objects have been loaded.

If your program needs some command line arguments, supply them after "main".
